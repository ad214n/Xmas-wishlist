## Overview
This is my first app that I created using the MERN stack. This app allows people of all ages to create their Christmas wishlists. 
The user is able to create an account and also add, edit, and delete items in their own personal wishlist. There is also a page where users are able to view other users' profiles or wishlists. 

List of Technologies Used:
